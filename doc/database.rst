Database
========

Before we can start installing dino the database needs to be prepared. There
are no special requrements so any database `supported by django`_ may be used.
Official support is given for SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB.

With the exception of SQLite these instructions assume that your database system
was installed, intialized, correctly configured and started and only deals with
aspects relevant to our setup.

.. _`supported by django`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-DATABASE-ENGINE

SQLite
------

By default dino uses a SQLite database, which is just a file on your disk. In
this case, no configuration is necessary. Please keep in mind that, while being
a capable database, SQLite does not scale well and has weaker guarantees than
server-based database solutions like PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL
----------

`The Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL>`_ describes PostgreSQL as:

  (...) an open source object-relational database management system with an
  emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance.

Create a new user and database for dino:

.. code-block:: console

  postgres@host:~$ createuser dino -P
  Enter password for new role: ******
  Enter it again: ******
  postgres@host:~$ createdb dino --owner=dino

.. note::
  If you are installing dino using ``pip``, the setup can be password-less using
  a UNIX socket connection and `Peer Authentication`_.

Install the python PostgreSQL client library:

.. code-block:: console

  root@host:~# pip install psycopg2
  Collecting psycopg2
    Cache entry deserialization failed, entry ignored
    Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/...
  (...)
  Successfully installed psycopg2-2.7.7

.. _`Peer Authentication`: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-peer.html

MySQL / MariaDB
---------------

`MariaDB <https://mariadb.org/about/>`_ describes itself as:

  (...) one of the most popular database servers in the world. Itâ€™s made by the
  original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. Notable users
  include Wikipedia, WordPress.com and Google.

Create a new user and database for dino:

.. code-block:: console

  root@host:~# mysql
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE dino DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dino.* TO dino@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '*********';
  mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Install the python MySQL client library:

.. code-block:: console

  root@host:~# pip install mysqlclient
  Collecting mysqlclient
  Cache entry deserialization failed, entry ignored
  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/...
  (...)
  Successfully installed mysqlclient-1.4.2.post1
